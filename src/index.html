          In 2022, there were 46 million people living in the United States who
          had moved there from somewhere else. Each dot here represents 10,000
          people.

          In this project, we will focus on one small subset of immigrants:

          We follow these immigrants in the Bay Area, as well as later

          immigrant parents, or even native-born parents.

          To start, we zoom in to focus on one typical example: a family of three who immigrated from Asia. 
          The parents, Jennifer and James Wang, are first-generation immigrants; their daughter, Elizabeth, is 2nd-gen. 
          Elizabeth’s son, James, would be considered 3rd-gen.

          Over the course of this project, we will be analyzing the American Dream and testing its validity through four main component 
          parts: Education, Occupation, Income, and Healthcare. While we are aware that these four components are not a 
          measure of success for every individual, these benchmarks were chosen based on completed and ongoing research of 
          sociologists and anthropologists, as well as previous Census analysis, studying success and well-being in America for 
          native-born citizens and immigrants alike.

    <h2>Education</h2>
  <br>
        <h3>
          Jessica and James Wang have decided to move from their home country to pursue further education in the United States. 
          They choose to settle in the Bay Area to attend school. 
          First, let’s take a look at educational attainment across the generations. 
          How do they fare compared to their daughter, Elizabeth, or Elizabeth’s son Daniel?
        </h3>

          To understand education, we can compare the highest level of education achieved.
          For a fair comparison, we limit our data to adults who are not in school.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="edu2" data-edu="2">
        <p>
          First, here is the distribution for first-generation immigrants.
          The plurality of first-generation immigrants have a post-secondary
          degree (i.e., they've graduated with an Associate's or Bachelor's
          degree).
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="edu3" data-edu="3">
        <p>
          Second generation immigrants have higher educational attainment:
          they all have receive at minimum primary education, and most at least
          graduate high school.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="edu4" data-edu="4">
        <p>
          In later generations, we see that education attainment starts to
          flatten. A greater proportion of this generation have at least a
          primary or secondary education, but the number of those with college
          degrees decrease.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="edu5" data-edu="5">
        <p>
          Comparing to the Bay Area population averages, we find that, although
          second generation immigrants have higher educational attainment, later
          generations actually fall <i>below</i> the general population.
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 
        <div class="step" data-step="edu6">
        <p>
          Within the Wang Family, Jessica and James graduated from an American university with Bachelor’s degrees. 
          Their daughter, Elizabeth, is more likely to outperform them shooting for a Bachelor’s or a postgraduate degree. 
          However, their grandson Daniel is most likely to attain at least a high school diploma, but is less likely to 
          earn a degree than his parents, grandparents, or someone from a non-immigrant family.

        After achieving their degrees, Jessica and James start looking for work in their respective industries. 
        Next, let’s take a look at class and occupation across generations to see how they fare compared to Elizabeth or Daniel.  
        Are they able to find work in their fields?

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>
        Trends similar to educational attainment also occur in the workforce. While first and second
        generation Chinese immigrants have a larger proportion of their
        respective populations working in white collar jobs, that fraction falls
        for third and later generations compared to the general Bay Area
        population.

      <h2>Income</h2>
      <br>

      <h3>
        Jessica and James were able to find jobs! 
        However, the Bay Area is one of the most expensive places to live in the United States, with a high associated cost of living. 
        One of the lures of working in the United States was increased wages and better ability for class mobility. 
        Next, let’s take a look at levels of income across generations to see how they fare compared to Elizabeth or Daniel. 
      </h3>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>
        We measure household income by total pre-tax wage and salary income - all money received as an employee (e.g. ages, salaries, 
        commissions, cash bonuses, tips, and other money income received from an employer) - for the previous year.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Similarly to occupation and educational attainment, a large proportion of 1st-gen could be considered middle or upper income,
        followed by the second-gen which also has a large proportion of its population in upper income, though less than 1st gen. 
        Second-gen and third-gen and later are similar when it comes to being categorized as middle income, but third-gen is less likely 
        than second-gen or first-gen to reach upper income.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Immigrant generations overall perform better than population when it comes to income, 
        but third-gen is closest to the trends in income displayed by the general population.

      <h2>Healthcare</h2>
      <br>

      <h3>
        Jessica has been injured in a car accident. After suffering with neck and back pain, 
        she decides to go to the closest hospital’s Emergency Room for treatment. However, the 
        United States is well-known for having a very high cost of care, which can be life-altering for 
        residents who are underinsured or uninsured. In the last part of our analysis, let’s take a look at 
        healthcare coverage across generations to see how they fare compared to Elizabeth or Daniel. 
      </h3>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>
        Healthcare coverage is measured by self-reporting. Coverage is defined as the household being covered 
        by any kind of healthcare insurance, including private insurance provided by an employer, medicare, medicaid,
        or US military insurance.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Immigrants across the board are more likely to have healthcare coverage than the general population. 
        Vice versa, they are also less likely to be uninsured than the general population. 
        Third-gen is the best covered when compared to all other generations, though the margin is small.

      <br>

      <p>
        The data shows us that when it comes the American Dream, it is not equally
        applied across all generations of immigrants. As a family reaches assimilation, the American Dream fades
        from reach. While 1st generation strives for achievement and 2nd generation outperforms their parents, 
        3rd-gen and on struggle, lagging behind both previous generations of their family and population average.

      <h2>Glossary</h2>
      <br>

      <ul>
        <li>The American Dream: 
          
          For the scope of this project, we have defined the American Dream as a sum of four 
          component parts: education, income, class/occupation, and healthcare coverage. Those who have “achieved” the American 
          Dream and have been most successful under it have access to high levels of education and income, are covered adequately 
          by their healthcare providers, and are able to attain high class status. </li>
        <br>

        <li>Generations: 
          
          In this project we define four main categories of immigrant generation: 1, 1.5, 2, and 3+. 
          The first generation are the original immigrants to the United States. 2nd-gen consists of their children 
          whether native-born or born outside the US. The 3rd generation is composed of the grandchildren of the 1st generation, 
          born within the US and any subsequent children born of the 2nd generation. </li>
        <br>

          <li>Bay Area: 
            
            Within the scope of this project we are defining the Bay Areas as the following counties: 
            Alameda, Marin, San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Sonoma, Solano, Napa, and Contra Costa.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary: Elementary and Middle School</li>
        <li>Secondary: High school</li>
        <li>Post-Secondary: Associate’s Degree, Bachelor’s Degree</li>
        <li>Post-graduate: Professional Degree, Doctorate</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Occupation</h3>
      <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Blue-Collar: Working-class professions that involve a greater degree of 
          physically-taxing or manual labor (e.g. farmers, mechanics, power plant 
          operators, and electricians)</li>
        <li>White-Collar: Industry worker, characterized by working inside an office</li>
        <li>Class Mobility: The ability to change your socio-economic situation, 
          either in relation to parents (intergenerational mobility) or throughout 
          your lifetime (intra-generational mobility).</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Income</h3>
      <br>
      <p>To define income classes, we follow the Pew Research Center’s 
        classifications of low income, middle income, and upper income for an average family of 3. </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Low Income: Less than $52,200 combined household income</li>
        <li>Middle Income: $52,200 - $156,600</li>
        <li>Upper Income: More than $156,600</li>
      </ul>


      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Healthcare</h3>
      <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Underinsured: While an underinsured person may have healthcare coverage, 
          the sum they are insured for or the policy they hold is inadequate to cover their needs. </li>
      </ul>
