      The American Dream is a throughline in the United States mythos: the
      idea that, regardless of your social, geographical, or economic
      background, hard work and perseverance will lead you to a better life in
      America. This idea has made the United States a country of immigrants.

        For as long as this idea has existed, though, so too has the doubt that
        the American Dream is real.
        In this article, we focus on exploring the <span class="definition"
        data-content="For the scope of this project, we have defined the
        American Dream as a sum of four component parts: education, income,

        Using Census data from March 2022 — the most recent available at the time
      of publication — this project only represents a small, static slice of the
      <!-- Chinese immigrants who reside in the Bay Area instead of across the -->
      rich, complicated history that is immigration in the United States.
      <!-- history of the United States.  -->
      However, we aim to showcase the larger trends in the data and analyze
      what that means for an average Chinese immigrant household today and
      their ability to achieve socio-economic success.

      <h2>The Wangs</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>
        To start, we zoom in to focus on one typical example: an immigrant
      family from China who has settled in the Bay Area.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>The parents, <span class="highlight" data-color="#23171B">Jennifer and
      James Wang</span>, are <span class="definition" data-content="A first generation immigrant is someone who was born outside of the U.S. and is now a resident within the U.S.">first-generation immigrants</span>. This means they were
      born outside of the United States.
      <!-- </p> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      Their daughter, <span class="highlight dark"
        data-color="#16B686">Elizabeth</span>, was born in the United States.
      That means she is a <span class="definition" data-content="A second generation immigrant is defined as a native-born person with foreign-born parents.">second generation immigrant</span>.
      <!-- </p> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      Elizabeth has a son, <span class="highlight dark"
        data-color="#FEB927">Daniel</span>; he would be considered <span class="definition" data-content="Third generation immigrants are native-born children of second generation immigrants.">third-generation</span>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In our analysis, partly as a limitation of the Census data, we group
        Daniel together with all other native-born Bay area residents of Chinese
        descent born to native-born parents as third-or-later generation immigrants.
      </p>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   The parents, Jennifer and James Wang, are first-generation immigrants; their daughter, Elizabeth, is 2nd-gen. Elizabeth’s son, James, would be considered 3rd-gen. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      <br/>
      <p>
        While many immigrants have stories like the Wang family, the story of
        this family in particular is a fictional narrative used as a tool to help
        highlight trends in the data.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Throughout this project, we will be analyzing the American Dream and testing its validity through four main component parts: Education, Occupation, Income, and Healthcare. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        While we are aware that these four components are not a measure of
        success for every individual, these benchmarks were chosen based on
        completed and ongoing research of sociologists and anthropologists, as
        well as previous Census analysis, studying success and well-being in
        America for native-born citizens and immigrants alike.

        Trends similar to educational attainment also occur in the workforce.

      </p>
      <br/>

Most members of the first generation are classed as low income. Compared to the general population, the middle class shrinks while the low income group grows. However, there are also more first-generation immigrants with upper-class income.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>

Looking at the upper class, we find a similar trend to education and occupational class: first- and second-generation immigrants outperform the general population while third-and-later generation immigrants fall short.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
However, the lower income brackets tell a different story. Third-and-later generation immigrants have the most robust middle class and the smallest low-income group compared to both immigrants and the general population.

James and Jessica came to the Bay Area with career trajectories that already gave them a decent chance of becoming high-earners. However, as they are just starting out in a new country, they might not be able to make as much as someone with a more stable foundation. Elizabeth follows in their same footsteps, pursuing a white collar career in law. She is more likely than her parents to reach upper income, using the springboard of her parent’s status to overachieve.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <br>

      <p>
        Success is a highly personal benchmark. For some, success means that
      they are working a job they enjoy. For others, it can mean earning a high
      salary in their chosen field. For others still, it rests in intangible
      measures and emotional indicators such as happiness.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        We cannot measure if Chinese immigrants such as the Wang family and
      their future generations are successful as a monolith. However, recent
      Census data shows us that, when it comes to the American Dream, all
      generations of immigrants display a difference in their achievement of
      the four benchmarks analyzed in this article. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As Chinese immigrant families reach the third-generation and beyond, we
      see that the educational and occupational achievement displayed by the
      first generation, and then outperformed by the second, decreases.
      However, they have the most access to healthcare, and when it comes to
      economic achievement, we see mixed results.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There is a large shift towards immigrants of third generation and later
      achieving wages within middle-income, even more than the general
      population of the Bay Area and earlier immigrant generations. Yet, fewer
      members of these later generations are able to achieve the same
      upper-income status of their parents and grandparents. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        While ultimately it is up to individuals to define their own success, the socioeconomic indicators analyzed in this article imply that the closer that Chinese immigrant families move towards assimilation, the less likely they are to overachieve within these measures, with the exception of healthcare coverage. They are less likely to attain postsecondary or postgrad education and are more likely to work Blue Collar jobs and earn middle-income salaries. 
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        With the data and analysis we have, we can't make any claims as to why
        these trends exist. That remains an open question for future research.
        Perhaps there are systemic barriers that prevent later generations from
        reaching the same heights as their preceding generations. Or perhaps
        later generations simply have different goals in mind.

    <b>About the data:</b> We used the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) for the Current
      Population Survey for Social, Economic and Health Research (CPS) from the
      Census Bureau, because it has survey data on a variety of socioeconomic
      variables as well as foreign-born and parental birthplace information,
      which we can use to study immigrant generations. This is a nationally
      representative survey of the US population taken in March of every year.
</p>
      <p>
      We are using the March 2022 dataset, which is the
      most recent data for the ASEC. The Census provides both tabulations of
      the data and microdata, which contain responses from individuals, with
      disclosure avoidance techniques that prevent the identification of
      specific individuals. We use the microdata as prepared by the IPUMS
      project at the University of Minnesota, which processes datasets from a
      variety of national agencies and organizations and provides an interface
      to request subsets with specific variables.
    </p>
      <p>
      To narrow the scope of the project, almost all of our analysis focuses on
      a smaller slice of the ASEC: Chinese immigrants to the San Francisco Bay
      Area. We chose this subset because of our familiarity with the immigrant
      population as well as the regional relevance of the immigrant
      destination, but with the awareness that this subset of immigrant stories
      is not representative of all immigrant stories (nor is that a feasible
      goal to pursue.)
