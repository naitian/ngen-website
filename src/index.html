      <p>
        The American Dream is a throughline in the United States mythos: the idea that, regardless of your social, geographical, or economic background, hard work and perseverance will lead you to a better life in America. This very idea has led people to immigrate to the United States for generations. However, millennials and subsequent generations of American residents, have begun to cast doubt on if the American Dream still exists despite ever-increasing class stratification.

        Using Census data from March 2022—the most recent available at the time of data collection—this project only represents a small, static slice of the Chinese Immigrants who reside in the Bay Area instead of across the history of the United States. However, we aim to showcase the larger trends in the data and analyze what that means for an average Chinese immigrant household today and their ability to achieve socio-economic success.

        To start, we zoom in to focus on one typical example: a family of three
      where the parents immigrated from China.

      <br/>
      <p>The parents, <span class="highlight" data-color="#23171B">Jennifer and

      <!-- <p> -->
      Their daughter, Elizabeth, was born in the United States. That means she is a second generation immigrant.

      <!-- <p> -->
      Elizabeth’s son, James, would be considered 3rd-gen.

      <!-- </p> -->
      <br/>
      <p>
        While the data used here is real, and many immigrants have stories like the Wang family, the story of this family is used as a narrative tool to help highlight trends in the data.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Throughout this project, we will be analyzing the American Dream and testing its validity through four main component parts: Education, Occupation, Income, and Healthcare. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        While we are aware that these four components are not a measure of success for every individual, these benchmarks were chosen based on completed and ongoing research of sociologists and anthropologists, as well as previous Census analysis, studying success and well-being in America for native-born citizens and immigrants alike.

          Jessica and James Wang have decided to move from their home country to pursue further education in the United States.

          Their grandson Daniel is most likely to attain at least a high school diploma, but is less likely to

      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In the first-generation, the largest proportion of households reported could be considered low or middle income, with a little less than 7% in upper income.

        James and Jessica came to the Bay Area with career trajectories that already gave them a decent chance of becoming high-earners. However, as they are just starting out in a new country, they might not be able to make as much as someone with a more stable foundation. They become solidly middle income. Elizabeth follows in their same footsteps, pursuing a white collar career in law. She is more likely than her parents to reach upper income, using the springboard of her parent’s income status to overachieve.

      <br>
      <h3>
        Daniel, her son, is most likely to achieve middle income status  – a combination of a lower likelihood of attaining the highest levels of education possible and higher likelihood of working a blue collar job.

        residents who are <span class="definition" data-content="While an underinsured person may have healthcare coverage, the sum they are insured for or the policy they hold is inadequate to cover their needs.">underinsured</span> or uninsured. In the last part of our analysis, let’s take a look at 
        healthcare coverage across generations to see how they fare compared to Elizabeth or Daniel. 
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Healthcare coverage is measured through a household’s self-reporting. Coverage here is defined as holding any kind of healthcare insurance, including private insurance provided by an employer, Medicare, Medicaid, or US military insurance.

      <p>
        Immigrants across the board are <span class="highlight dark" data-color="#FFFEF2">more likely</span> to have healthcare coverage than the general population. The opposite is also true, they are less likely to be uninsured than the general population. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The third generation and later are the <span class="highlight dark" data-color="#FFFEF2">best covered</span> when compared to all other generations, though the margin is small. Across the board, the data shows that all residents of the Bay Area are well-covered, with over 95% of the general population having some kind of healthcare insurance. However, it is notable that the Chinese immigrant population overall has a higher coverage rate compared to the rest of the population.

      <h3>
        In the face of any medical needs, James, Jessica, Elizabeth, and Daniel all have a high likelihood of being able to get the care they need, despite their different upbringings. Daniel, especially, has the greatest access to healthcare, as the most likely in his family to be insured.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <br>

      <p>
        What it means to be successful in the United States is a benchmark measured differently by each individual.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For some success means that they are working a job that they enjoy, for others it can mean earning a high salary in their chosen field, or for more it rests in intangible measures and emotional indicators such as happiness.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        We cannot measure if Chinese immigrants such as the Wang family and their future generations are successful as a monolith. However, recent Census data shows us that, when it comes to the American Dream, all generations of immigrants display a difference in their achievement of the four benchmarks analyzed in this article. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As Chinese immigrant families reach the third-generation and beyond, we see that the educational and occupational achievement displayed by the first generation, and then outperformed by the second, decreases. However, they have the most access to healthcare, and when it comes to economic achievement, we see mixed results.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There is a large shift towards immigrants of third generation and later achieving wages within middle-income, even more than the general population of the Bay Area and earlier immigrant generations. Yet, fewer members of these later generations are able to achieve the same upper-income status of their parents and grandparents. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        While ultimately it is up to individuals to define their own success, the socioeconomic indicators analyzed in this article imply that the closer that Chinese immigrant families move towards assimilation, the less likely they are to overachieve within these measures, with the exception of healthcare coverage. They are less likely to attain postsecondary or postgrad education and are more likely to work Blue Collar jobs and earn middle-income salaries.

        Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey from the US Census
        Bureau. This is a nationally representative survey of the US population
        taken in March of every year.
