The plurality of first-generation immigrants have a post-secondary degree (i.e., they've graduated with an Associate's or Bachelor's degree). </p> </div> <div class="step" data-step="edu3"> <p> Second generation immigrants have higher educational attainment: they all have receive at minimum primary education, and most at least graduate high school. </p> </div> <div class="step" data-step="edu4"> <p> In later generations, we see that education attainment starts to flatten. A greater proportion of this generation have at least a primary or secondary education, but the number of those with college degrees decrease. </p> </div> <div class="step" data-step="edu5"> <p> Comparing to the Bay Area population averages, we find that, although second generation immigrants have higher educational attainment, later generations actually fall <i>below</i> the general population. </p> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>
